# Homework 2 Description

## 1. Objective
* Create your own unique style sheet that will be used by three different html files

## 2. Getting Started
* You must complete the first Peer Graded Assignments to begin this one
* You can alter your previous styling choices but I assume those changes are complete

## 3. You must leave the HTML alone
Create a single style sheet that updates:  
* body, header, `h1`, the links, the active, left and right classes, and the images in the left class.

## 4. Body
* Change the padding and margin
* Feel free to adjust the size of the text, but it is not required.

## 5. Header
* Change the background color
* Add backgrond image, using the image provided in the css folder
    * If you have trouble with this part, keep an eye out for sample code in cal-table.css. The key is to master the folder structure

## 6. h1
* Change the font color
* Increase the font size

## 7. The Navigation Links
* Style ONLY those links in the `nav` element.
* You don't need to recreate my example exactly, but they should be spaced apart.
* Make sure to round the borders and remove the underline

## 8. active class
* Use the background color and font color to create an active class
* This class is used to distinguish the current page from the others

## 9. left and right class
* These two elements should be side-by-side
* Change the background color for the left class

## 10. Images
* Put the images back in and put a border around them.
* Make sure that they are centered within the .left class
* Put spacing between them on the top and bottom too.

## 11. Peer grading
* Grades will be based on level of completion
* Some aesthetics will come into play this time. It is important that images are not "squished" together: use validators
* Proper standards to apply
* You can specify your preferred screen size for grading
