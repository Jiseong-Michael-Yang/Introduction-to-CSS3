# Homework Description

## 1. Objective
* Create your own unique style sheet that will be used by three different html files.

## 2. You must leave the HTML alone
* Create style sheet that updates:
    * header, headings, section, links and images

### 1. header
* Change background color
* Make sure the heading is displayed in all captial letters
* For just h1:
    * Center the text

### 2. section
* Change the background color

### 3. Links
* Change the background color and font color
* ~~Center the text (subtle change)~~

### 4. Images
* Since we haven't talked yet about the best way to get those images where we want them, just use CSS3 to remove them from the page. 

## 3. Peer Grading
* Grades will be used on level of completion, not aesthetics
* Proper standards do apply
* Only style the listed elements, otherwise it makes it harder to grade
