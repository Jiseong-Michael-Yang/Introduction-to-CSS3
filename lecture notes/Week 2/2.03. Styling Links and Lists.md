# Styling Links and Lists

## 1. Anchor Links
* Links can take on all of the usual style as well as <font color="orange">_text-decoration_</font>

```
a {
    display: block;
    font-weight: bold;
    color: #FFFFFF;
    background-color: #0006CC;
    width: 200px; # Only works with inline and inline-block
    text-align: center;
    padding: 4px;
    text-decoration: none; # Removes the underline
}
```

## 2. Buttons
* Many designers try to make their links look like buttons.
* Be semantic, if you want a button use the `<button>` element instead
`<button>Click Me!</button>`: <button>Click Me!</button>

## 3. States
* Some links are blue, some are purple, etc. Why???
    * a:link - a normal, unvisited link
    * a:visited - has been visited
    * a:hover - activated by mouse (touchscreens...?, not necessarily)
    * a:focus - activated with the keyboard
    * a:active - is being clicked
* Hands-on
    * [HTML](../../codes/html/links.html)
    * [CSS](../../codes/css/links.css)

## 4. Precedence of Rules
* a:hover MUST come after a:link and a:visited
* a:active MUST come after a:hover

## 5. Styling Lists
* Number of properties beyond font, margin, etc.
    * list-style-type
    * list-style-image
    * list-style-position
    * list-style

### 01. list-style-type
* list-style-type
    * ordered lists: _lower-roman, upper-roman, decimal, decimal-leading-zero, upper-alpha, lower-alpha, hebrew, armenian, ..._
    * unordered list: _Override the default marker with cirlces, discs, or squares_

* list-style-image
    * Use a custom image instead of traditional marker
    ```
    ul {
        list-style-image: square url('icon.gif')
    }
    ```
