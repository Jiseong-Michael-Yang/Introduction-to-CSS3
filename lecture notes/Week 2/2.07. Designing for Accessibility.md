# Designing for Accessibility

## Overview
* The content of your page should be in the HTML.
* It is tempting to add content via colors, images, etc.
* Follow the POUR guidelines
    * <font color="orange"><U>Perceivable</U></font>, Operable, <font color="orange"><U>Understandable</U></font>, Robust

## 1. Perceivable
* Provide text alternatives for images
* Provide captions and transcriptions for video and audio
* Use correct semantic markup so content can be presented in different ways
* <font color="orange">Make it easier for users to see content by using good color contrast</font>

## 2. Operable
* _All functionality available from the keyboard!_
* Users have control over timing and limits
* Do not cause seizures (don't flash content)
* Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are

## 3. Understandable
* Economical and plain use of language
* Text supplemented with illustrations, videos, and other favorite formats where appropriate (e.g. use good Universal Design
* Navigation, information structure are discernable and consistent
* Make pages operate in predictable ways
* Help users avoid and correct mistakes

## 4. Robust
* Is your site functional across various technologies (smart phone, screen reader, laptop, pensticks, etc...)?
* Syntax errors that don't affect visual presentation may hamper assitive technology and accessibility tools
* Adhering to W3C standards ensures future compatilibity
* Validate your code at <font color="orange">validator.w3c.org</font> and <font color="orange">wave.webaim.org</font>

## Review
* Accessibility starts with proper HTML tags
* Styling can actually make it HARDER for some people to access the information
* Get into the early habit of utilizing accessbility tools
* "Cool" new style should not be at the cost of accessibilty
