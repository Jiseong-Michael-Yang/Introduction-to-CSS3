# Advanced Selectors

## 1. Styling Specific Objects
* We have focused on _type_ selectors.
* What if you don't want to style _all_ of the links, just some? Or just some of the lists?
* CSS gives you options

## 2. Selectors
### 01. CSS Selectors
* Some selectors follow the DOM
* Descendant selectors (`nav a`)
    * Style all of the anchor links inside a nav tag
* Child selectors (`nav > a`)
    * More constraining. The anchor element must be a child of the nav, no intermediate tags, e.g. paragraph
* Adjacent sibling (`h1 + ol`)
    * elements must be at same level and follow each other

### 02. id Selectors
* `#` id selector
    * Used to identify a single element in the DOM.
    * Was used extensively for `<div id="header">`, `<div id="footer">`, etc.
    * There is a small movement to move the use of id OUT of CSS  
```
#mainLogo {
    border: 5px solid #0006CC;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

<img src="logo.jpg" id="mainLogo" alt="logo"/>
```

### 03. class Selector
* `.` class selector
    * Used to identify an element in the DOM that is part of a special class of items
    * Think of thumbnail images, all of the links that are in the navigation, your social media images, etc ...
```
.thumb {
    border: 1px solid #0006CC;
    width: 20%;
}

<img src="cat.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Joe"/>
<img src="dog.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Bacon"/>
<img src="bird.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Tweety"/>
```

### 04. classes vs. ids
* Syntax is "." and "#"
* classes can be used multiple times
* id should be unique
* Think of images and navigation bars
    * Format numerous (**but not all**) images the same way: use class
    * Visually signify the current page

### 05. Scope
#### A. Narrowing the Scope
* As you get more advanced pages, you will want to narrow the scope of the action
* <font color="orange">p.main</font> $\rightarrow$ paragraphs using main class
* <font color="orange">header img.special</font> $\rightarrow$ images inside header that use special class

#### B. Expanding the Scope
* You can combine elements with a comma 
* <font color="orange">p, h1, #main, .special</font>{...rules to apply to all of them...}
* Review: What happens when there are multiple rules for the same selector?
    * When there are conflicts, use the one processed most recently
    * UNLESS a rule has <font color="orange">!important</font>

### 06. More Selectors
* Universal
    * `*` applies styling to every element on the page
    * `Ackk!!` Try this!
* Attribute Selectors
    - a[href="infor.html"]
* Pseudo-Classes
* Pseudo-Elements

## 3. Attribute Selectors
* You may want to search the DOM for certain elements that have an attribute you are looking for
    * All the images that use gif files...
    * All of the images that have empty alt text...
    * All of the links that go to government sites...

### 01. Using Operators
* Operators can be used to find those attributes values you are looking for
    * `^`: _match the beginning exactly_  
    e.g. `a[href^="http://umich"]`
    * `$`: _match the end exactly_  
    e.g. `img[src$ = ".png"]` $\rightarrow$ _apply to .png images_
    * `*`: _wildcard_  
    e.g. `img[href* = ".png"]` $\rightarrow$ _apply to any reference_
