# Advanced Selectors

## 1. Styling Specific Objects
* We have focused on _type_ selectors.
* What if you don't want to style _all_ of the links, just some? Or just some of the lists?
* CSS gives you options

## 2. CSS Selectors
### 01. Type Selectors
* Some selectors follow the DOM
* Descendant selectors (`nav a`)
    * Style all of the anchor links inside a `nav` tag
* Child selectors (`nav > a`)
    * More constraining. The anchor element must be a child of the `nav`, no intermediate tags, e.g. paragraph
* Sibling Selectors
    * General Sibling Selector (`h2 ~ p`)
        * `p` following `h2` that share the same parent anywhere after
    * Adjacent Sibling Selector (`h2 + p`)
        * `p` following `h2` that share the same parent directly after

### 02. id Selectors
* `#` id selector
    * Used to identify a single element in the DOM.
    * Was used extensively for `<div id="header">`, `<div id="footer">`, etc.
    * There is a small movement to move the use of id OUT of CSS  
```
#mainLogo {
    border: 5px solid #0006CC;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

<img src="logo.jpg" id="mainLogo" alt="logo"/>
```

### 03. class Selector
* `.` class selector
    * Used to identify an element in the DOM that is part of a special class of items
    * Think of thumbnail images, all of the links that are in the navigation, your social media images, etc ...
```
.thumb {
    border: 1px solid #0006CC;
    width: 20%;
}

<img src="cat.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Joe"/>
<img src="dog.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Bacon"/>
<img src="bird.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Tweety"/>
```

### 04. classes vs. ids
* Syntax is "." and "#"
* classes can be used multiple times
* id should be unique
* Think of images and navigation bars
    * Format numerous (**but not all**) images the same way: use class
    * Visually signify the current page

### 05. Scope
#### A. Narrowing the Scope
* As you get more advanced pages, you will want to narrow the scope of the action
* <font color="orange">p.main</font> $\rightarrow$ paragraphs using main class
* <font color="orange">header img.special</font> $\rightarrow$ images inside header that use special class

#### B. Expanding the Scope
* You can combine elements with a comma 
* <font color="orange">p, h1, #main, .special</font>{...rules to apply to all of them...}
* Review: What happens when there are multiple rules for the same selector?
    * When there are conflicts, use the one processed most recently
    * UNLESS a rule has <font color="orange">!important</font>

### 06. More Selectors
* Universal
    * `*` applies styling to every element on the page
    * `Ackk!!` Try this!
* Attribute Selectors
    - a[href="infor.html"]
* Pseudo-Classes
* Pseudo-Elements

## 3. Attribute Selectors
* You may want to search the DOM for certain elements that have an attribute you are looking for
    * All the images that use gif files...
    * All of the images that have empty alt text...
    * All of the links that go to government sites...

### 01. Attribute Present Selector
* The first attribute selector identifies an element based on whether it includes an attribute or not  
```
a[target] {...}

<a href="#" target="_blank">...</a>
```

### 02. Attribute Equal Selector
* Identifies an element with a specific, and exact matching
```
a[href="http://google.com/"] {...}

<a href="http://google.com/">...</a>
```

### 03. Attribute Contains Selector
* Finds an element based on part of an attribute value, but not the exact match.
```
a[href*="login"] {...}

<a href="/login.php">...</a>
```

### 04. Attribute Begins with Selector
* Selects an element based on what an attribute value begins with.
```
a[href^="https://] {...}

<a href="https://chase.com">...</a>
```

### 05. Attribute Ends with Selector
* Selects the element based on what an attribute value ends with.
```
a[href$=".pdf"] {...}

<a href="/docs/menu.pdf">...</a>
```

### 06. Attribute Spaced Selector
* Matches the element with one of whose whitespace-separated attribute values.
```
a[rel~="tag] {...}

<a href="#" rel="tag nofollow">...</a>
```

### 07. Attribute Hyphenated Selector
* Matches the element with one of whose hyphen-separated attribute values.
```
a[lang|="en] {...}

<a href="#" lang="en-US">...</a>
```

## 4. Note
* We have actually covered a lot in this short video
* Know that each of these ideas can merge. One element can have many classes and ids associated with it  
`<li class="special early dark" id = "main">`
* Browsers "starts at the top" and applies each rule, sometimes overriding earlier rules.

## 5. The Good News
* You can use style sheets from others to style your code, just by adding class!!
* You can override style sheets from others just by rewriting the class, or making your own version of it and linking it last

## Review
* Type selectors can be combined to narrow the scope of where rules are applied
* An id is used to specify a specific element in a page
* Classes can be used to associate elements that should treated in a similar manner
