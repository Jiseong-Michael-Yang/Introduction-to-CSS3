# Browser Capabilities

## 1. Browser Differ
* Even though browsers are moving to a consistent implementation of HTML, they differ in display and adherence
* It is your responsibility to make sure your page works for a wide audience

## 2. Handling Stylistic Differences
* "Easiest" way to eliminate browser difference is to use a default style sheet
* Default style sheets reset all of the values for the page
* Will make your page look worse! (price to pay)

## 3. Handling Unsupported Properties
* Not all browsers support all HTML5 tags
* Not all browsers support all CSS3 properties
* Browser prefixes (or vendor prefixes) provide a quick fix for handling unsupported CSS3 options

## 4. Browser Prefixes
* -webkit-: Android, Chrome, iOS, Safari
* -moz-: Firefox
* -ms-: Internet Explorer
* -o-: Opera

## 5. Often Unsupported Properties
* column-count
* border-radius
* gradient
* Sites such as http://caniuse.com/ will tell you when you need to use prefixes

## 6. Example
* [HTML](../../codes/html/prefixes.html)
* [CSS](../../codes/css/prefixes.css)

## 7. Automated Ways to Include Prefixes
* For now, add the prefixes by hand
* There are ways to automate the addition of prefixes
    * Editor add-ons (You have most of the control)
    * Use outside programs to dynamically add appropriate prefix based on browser

## Review
* Default style sheets remove stylistic differences
    * Should style sheets be internal or external? (external preferred because internal style sheet overrides works)
    * Where should it go in relation to other style sheets?
* Browser prefixes can help remove some differences caused by unsupported options
    * Shouldn't be oversued (check to apply if only neccessary)
