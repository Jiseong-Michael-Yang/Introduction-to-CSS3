# Transitions

## 1. Transitions
* When elements transition from one state to another, you can alter their appearance
    * If you hover over the link, change the color
    * If an image comes into focus, change the size

## 2. Properties
* transition-property
    * What is it you want to change? (size, color, position, etc.)
* transition-duration
    * How long should each transition last?
* transition-timing
    * Should it be a smooth transition (linear)? Or different?
* transition-delay
    * How long should the wait be before transition begins?


## 3. Setting Up
1. Define your element
2. Choose the elements for transition
3. Define the new values
    * You must combine this step with a pesudo-class

## 4. Steps
```
div {
    color: #000000;
    background: #2DB34A;
    line-height: 200px;
    text-align: center; 
    width: 250px;
    height: 200px;
    border-radius: 6px;

    transition-property: color, width, background, boder-radius;
    transition-duration: .5s;
    transition-timing-function: linear;
    transition-delay: .5s;
}

div:hover {
    color: #FFFFFF;
    width: 350px;
    background: #2D31B3;
    border-radius: 50%;
}
```

## 5. Using Shorthands
* If you have multiple properties transitioning, you can use shorthand:
    ```
    transition: background .2s linear, border-radius 1s ease-in 1s;
    ```

## Review
* Transition can be used to create fun aspects to your page
* Playing with them will help you better understand element states (active, focus, etc.)
* Accessiblity, as always, is an issue.
