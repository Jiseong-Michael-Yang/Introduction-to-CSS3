# Positioning

## 1. Position Properties
* The four position properties are:
    * static
    * relative
    * absolute
    * fixed
* Position are modified by the properties: top, right, bottom, left

### 01. Static
* Default value for elements
* Place in the next available position
* Not affected by the top, bottom, left, and right properties.

### 02. Relative
* Positioned "relative to itself"
* Take the static position, but add offsetsw
* The new positioning does NOT affect any other element. It is possible to move an element and leave a big hole where it would have been
* Relatively positioned elements are often used as container blocks for other elements

### 03. Absolute
* Element is removed from the document flow and positioned relative to its _<font color="orange">nearest ancestor</font>_ (or the root)
* Other elements behave as if element does not exist
* Can end up on top of another element

### 04. fixed
* Positioned relative to the _<font color="orange">browser window</font>_
* Will not move, even if the window is scrolled
    * IE7 and IE8 support the fixed value only if a `!DOCTYPE` is specified
* Think of popup boxes that won't go away!
* Or a navigation bar that is always hidden on the top
